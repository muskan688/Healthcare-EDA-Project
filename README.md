# Exploring Drowsiness Patterns in Wearable Device Data
You are a data scientist working for a wearable technology company that produces smartwatches  with vital signs sensors.Your task is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset collected from these  smartwatches.

Dataset Details-

Columns:

- heartRate: Heart rate readings from the smartwatch sensors.
- ppgGreen, ppgRed, ppgIR: PPG (Photoplethysmography) sensor readings in green, red, and infrared wavelengths respectively.
- drowsiness: Label indicating the level of drowsiness based on an adapted Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Values range from 0.0 to 2.0, where 0.0 represents alertness and 2.0 represents significant drowsiness.
